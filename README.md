# Heise Archiv Downloader

This is an easy bash script for downloading the PDF's per year out of the Heise magazine archiv.
Copy this script to your Linux, make it executable and run the script. Parameter 1 is the year.

Sometimes the download is blocked, the PDF is very small and contains HTML. Than you have to delete the file, wait and run the script later agin.
